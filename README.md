<h5># WebCrawling</h5>
<h2><b>Web crawling with R and Pythonwith a keyword specification</b></h2>

How to gather the data from the web?
If you look for 'web crawling' on any search engines,
you will get the information about various tools.

But I found an unpleasant matter while I was doing a research for the web crawling.
I could not specify for a keyword search with scrapy nor python package 'beautifulsoup'.

So here is the curious question arose.
Is there no way to specify a certain word when we extract data from the web?
Here I am going to explore the domain to find the answer.

As I mentioned above, there are various tools for web crawling.
Here we are going to deal data with three tools:
<a href="#scrapy">1. Scrapy with python</a>
<a href="#beautifulsoup">2. Python package -  beautifulsoup</a>
<a href="#rcrawler">3. R library - Rcrawler</a>

And whatever you use, it is not avoidable to install <b>JAVA</b>.
There are plenty of information about the installation which you can find easily on the internet.
So I will not handle the object here.

Now let's choose the keyword to collect the information about.
I select this one:
<b>mars travel</b>

As you guess there are tons of information on the web so we need to pick a certain website.
Then I decide to scrap webpages from the British news company BBC (https://www.bbc.com).
