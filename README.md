How to scrap data from the web?
If you look for 'web crawling' on any search engines,
you will get the information about various tools.

But I found an unpleasant matter while I was doing a research for the web crawling.
I could not specify for a keyword search with scrapy nor pythong package 'beautifulsoup'.

So here is the curious question arose.
Is there no way to specify a certain word with these tools?
I am going to explore the domain to find the answer.
